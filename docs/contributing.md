# Contributing

We’d love your help — docs, examples, and fixes are all welcome.

Docs
- Edit Markdown under `docs/`
- Preview locally:
  ```
  make docs-serve
  # open http://127.0.0.1:4000/tyk-cli/
  ```
- Keep it friendly and example-first

Code
- Fork → branch → PR
- Keep PRs focused and shippable
- Add tests where it helps future you

Optional: “Edit this page” links
If you want quick edit links, add this to `docs/_config.yml`:
```
gh_edit_link: true
gh_edit_link_text: "Edit this page on GitHub"
gh_edit_repository: "https://github.com/sedkis/tyk-cli"
gh_edit_branch: "main"
gh_edit_source: "docs"
```
